EXAMPLE 1:
between lines 740-770 there are predefined cases and switch statments for the
the key phrases 'start' and 'stop'

EXAMPLE 2:
input:     output:
start ---->WORD
stop  ---->WORD
I'm 20 --->WORD'WORD NUMBER
I_am_20 -->WORD_WORD_NUMBER (when a non-specified character is entered, the
				program just prints the character)

EXAMPLE 4:
The difference between terminal and non terminal is whether it is a token to
be returned and printed to the termainal. Non terminals (such as heat_switch)
will be parsed further.
